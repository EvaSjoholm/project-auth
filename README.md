# Project Auth API
A group project together with Eva Sjöholm, Matilda Frid, Irupé Pozo Graviz and Vera Sjunnesson. 
Creating authentication to our own API with connecting endpoints using Postman and Compass, and a frontend visual using React and Redux. 

## The problem
Backend went pretty fast as a group, though issues accured when trying to understand how to devide the work working on one API/localhost, windows and Apple etc. Frontend took most of the time making sure to understand the bits from React and Redux to fetch the data and endpoints. We used packages for design which helped.
